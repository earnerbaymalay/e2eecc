# Project Behavior Rules

1. **Tech Stack:** Android, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose
2. **Coding Style:**
   - Use functional programming patterns where possible.
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
   - All UI strings must be extracted to `strings.xml`.
   - Compose components must be broken down into small, reusable files.
3. **Architecture:**
   - MVVM architecture.
   - UI communicates with ViewModel via Events.
   - ViewModel communicates with UI via StateFlow.
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Never leave empty catch blocks. Log all errors using Timber.
5. **Testing:**
   - When creating a new feature, suggest unit tests for the ViewModel immediately.

# Personal Preferences
- Be concise. Don't explain the code unless I ask. Just write the code.
- If I ask for a change, give me the specific file edit, don't rewrite the whole file unless necessary.
